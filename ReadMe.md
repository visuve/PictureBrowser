# Picture Browser

- This is merely a lame joke
- The name was inspired by this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP-gSnEBCJc
- Picture Browser is a tiny and fast, but uses a lot of memory
	- It uses Win32 and GDI+ only
	- The focus is speed over memory usage
	- Caching can be turned off from the menu
		- This is recommended, if you have a large folder with very high resolution images
